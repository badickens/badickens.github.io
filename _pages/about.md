I'm an experienced product development engineer transitioning into a new career as a Data Analyst. 
I want to focus more on the operations and decision components required for any business marketplace
that wants to successfully meet consumer needs.

Previously as an engineer, I worked extensively with cross-functional teams for the design and 
development of consumer products. As a Project/Design Engineer, I successfully managed and 
delivered to market several key products and upgrades used in the Pool/Spa Industry.  I performed 
all aspects of new product design, development, and production, which included Engineering Project 
Management, Engineering Design/Development, Integration/Unit Testing, Product Manager support, 
Manufacturing/Production support, Supply Chain Development, Product Technical Training, and 
development of Quality Assurance requirements.

I would be an asset to any data analysis team due to my attention to detail, ability to adapt and 
learn new skills.
